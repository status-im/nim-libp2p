## Channel half-closed states
##
## | State    | Closed local      | Closed remote
## |=============================================
## | Read     | Yes (until EOF)   | No
## | Write    | No                | Yes
##

# TODO: this is one place where we need to use
# a proper state machine, but I've opted out of
# it for now for two reasons:
#
# 1) we don't have that many states to manage
# 2) I'm not sure if adding the state machine
# would have simplified or complicated the code
#
# But now that this is in place, we should perhaps
# reconsider reworking it again, this time with a
# more formal approach.
