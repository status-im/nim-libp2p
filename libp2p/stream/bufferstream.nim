## This module implements an asynchronous buffer stream
## which emulates physical async IO.
##
## The stream is based on the standard library's `Deque`,
## which is itself based on a ring buffer.
##
## It works by exposing a regular LPStream interface and
## a method ``pushTo`` to push data to the internal read
## buffer; as well as a handler that can be registered
## that gets triggered on every write to the stream. This
## allows using the buffered stream as a sort of proxy,
## which can be consumed as a regular LPStream but allows
## injecting data for reads and intercepting writes.
##
## Another notable feature is that the stream is fully
## ordered and asynchronous. Reads are queued up in order
## and are suspended when not enough data available. This
## allows preserving backpressure while maintaining full
## asynchrony. Both writing to the internal buffer with
## ``pushTo`` as well as reading with ``read*` methods,
## will suspend until either the amount of elements in the
## buffer goes below ``maxSize`` or more data becomes available.
